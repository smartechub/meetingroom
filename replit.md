# Room Booking System

## Overview

This is a corporate room booking system built with React, Express, and PostgreSQL. It provides a comprehensive solution for managing meeting room reservations with role-based access control, calendar views, and administrative features. The project aims to offer a robust and user-friendly platform for efficient room management.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Authentication: Custom email/password authentication with traditional login forms.
Default admin credentials: admin@company.com / admin123

## System Architecture

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript.
- **UI Library**: Radix UI primitives with shadcn/ui components, featuring responsive design and a mobile menu.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with CSS variables for theming.
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state management.
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing.
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation.
- **Build Tool**: Vite.
- **UI/UX Decisions**: Booked time slots are visually highlighted (gray background, `cursor-not-allowed`) and clicking them shows a toast notification; comprehensive privacy controls ensure non-participants see redacted meeting details; a "Clear All" button for notifications is available.
- **Technical Implementations**: ParticipantSelector component provides multi-select, searchable user suggestions for booking forms; click-to-edit functionality for meetings directly from the calendar, with authorization checks; recurring bookings expand correctly in calendar views (daily, weekly, custom).

### Backend
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express server.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for type-safe operations, schema defined in `/shared/schema.ts`, and Drizzle Kit for migrations.
- **Authentication**: Custom email/password authentication using bcrypt for password hashing and Express sessions with PostgreSQL storage.
- **File Uploads**: Multer for handling attachments (PDF, DOCX, PPT, JPG, PNG up to 10MB) stored locally.
- **API Design**: RESTful API with JSON responses, including server-side privacy enforcement for booking details.
- **Core Features**:
    - **Authentication System**: Role-based access (admin, user, viewer) with secure password hashing.
    - **Room Management**: CRUD operations for rooms (admin only), including automatic seeding of default rooms.
    - **Booking System**: Create, edit, and manage reservations with real-time availability checks, conflict prevention, and quick booking directly from the calendar.
    - **Calendar Views**: Weekly and monthly displays with improved alignment, prominent scrollbars, and automatic scrolling to office hours.
    - **User Management**: Admin interface for user role management. User list endpoint (GET `/api/users`) is accessible to all authenticated users for participant selection.
    - **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive system activity tracking with detailed modal views.
    - **Email Functionality**: Integrated password reset, booking notifications, and reminders with configurable SMTP settings.
    - **Notifications**: Backend support for deleting all user notifications.

### Data Storage
- **Primary Database**: PostgreSQL via Replit environment, managed with Drizzle ORM.
- **Session Storage**: PostgreSQL-backed sessions using `connect-pg-simple`.
