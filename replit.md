## Recent Changes (October 27, 2025)

### Added: Click-to-Edit Meeting Functionality in Calendar View
- **Feature**: Meeting organizers can now click directly on their booked meeting time frames in the calendar to open the edit dialog
- **Implementation**:
  1. **Calendar Click Handler** (`CalendarView.tsx`):
     - Added `handleEditBooking()` function that checks if current user is the meeting organizer
     - Uses `currentUser.id === booking.userId` to verify ownership
     - Shows "Unauthorized" toast if non-organizer tries to edit
     - Properly handles recurring booking IDs using modulo operator (`booking.id % 100000`)
  2. **Edit Modal Dialog**:
     - Comprehensive form with all booking fields: title, room, dates, description, participants, repeat options, reminders
     - Real-time room availability checking that excludes the current booking being edited
     - Form pre-populated with existing booking data
     - Uses React Hook Form with Zod validation
  3. **Update Mutation**:
     - PUT request to `/api/bookings/:id` with updated booking data
     - Invalidates bookings cache on success
     - Shows success/error toast notifications
  4. **Critical Bug Fix**:
     - Fixed recurring booking ID normalization from `Math.floor(booking.id / 100000)` to `booking.id % 100000`
     - Previous logic caused edits to target wrong booking records (e.g., virtual ID 100045 â†’ 1 instead of 45)
     - Now correctly extracts actual booking ID: 100045 % 100000 = 45, 200045 % 100000 = 45
- **Security**:
  - Authorization enforced - only organizers can edit their meetings
  - Booking ID validation prevents editing unrelated bookings
- **Files Modified**:
  - `client/src/components/CalendarView.tsx` (edit functionality, modal, form handling)
- **User Experience**:
  - Organizers: Click on any of their booked meetings to edit details
  - Non-organizers: See "Unauthorized" toast if they try to edit someone else's meeting
  - Edit modal shows all booking details with real-time room availability feedback
  - Changes saved with single click on "Update Booking" button

### Added: Comprehensive Privacy Controls for Meeting Details
- **Feature**: Meeting organizers and participants see full meeting details (title, description, participants), while non-participants only see limited information (organizer, time, "Booked")
- **Implementation**:
  1. **Backend Privacy Enforcement** (`server/routes.ts`):
     - Updated `/api/bookings` endpoint to filter sensitive data server-side before sending to client
     - For each booking, checks if current user is organizer or participant
     - Uses case-insensitive email comparison (toLowerCase + trim) for robust participant matching
     - Returns full details (title, description, participants) only to authorized users
     - Returns redacted data ("Booked" title, null description, empty participants array) to non-participants
     - Organizer name/email remains visible to all for transparency
  2. **Frontend Display Logic** (`CalendarView.tsx`):
     - Added `canSeeFullDetails()` function to check authorization with case-insensitive email matching
     - Added `getBookingDisplayInfo()` to format display based on authorization
     - Participants/organizer see: Full meeting title, description, participant list, organizer name, meeting time
     - Non-participants see: "Booked", organizer name, meeting time
- **Security**: 
  - Privacy enforced server-side - sensitive data never sent to unauthorized clients
  - Network panel shows redacted data for non-participants
  - Email matching normalized (trim + lowercase) to prevent false negatives
- **Files Modified**:
  - `server/routes.ts` (backend privacy filtering)
  - `client/src/components/CalendarView.tsx` (frontend display logic)
- **User Experience**:
  - Organizers and participants see complete meeting information
  - Non-participants can see when rooms are booked and who organized it, but not the meeting subject or attendees
  - Privacy respected while maintaining calendar availability transparency

### Fixed: Booked Time Slots Now Highlighted and Protected
- **Issue**: Already booked time slots in the calendar scheduler were not visually highlighted, and users could still click on them, only to receive a backend error after trying to book
- **Root Cause**: 
  1. Frontend didn't have logic to detect fully booked slots
  2. The `/api/bookings` endpoint only returned a user's own bookings for non-admin users, so they couldn't see other people's bookings
- **Fix Applied**:
  1. **Smart Slot Detection**: Created `isSlotFullyBooked()` function that:
     - Collects all bookings overlapping with the time slot
     - Clips booking intervals to slot boundaries
     - Merges overlapping intervals to avoid double-counting
     - Returns true if total coverage equals or exceeds the full hour
     - Handles single full-hour bookings, multiple consecutive bookings (e.g., 9:00-9:30 + 9:30-10:00), and any combination
  2. **Click Prevention**: Updated `handleSlotClick()` to:
     - Check if slot is fully booked before opening booking dialog
     - Show toast notification: "This time slot is already booked. Please choose a different time or room."
     - Prevent wasted user effort by blocking unavailable slots upfront
  3. **Visual Highlighting**: Booked slots now display with:
     - Gray background (vs white for available slots)
     - `cursor-not-allowed` cursor on hover
     - No hover effect to clearly indicate unavailability
  4. **API Fix**: Changed `/api/bookings` to return all bookings for all users (required for calendar visibility)
     - Edit/delete restrictions remain in place on their respective endpoints
     - Users can now see which slots are taken by others
- **Files Modified**:
  - `client/src/components/CalendarView.tsx` (slot detection, highlighting, click prevention)
  - `server/routes.ts` (API endpoint fix)
- **User Experience Now**:
  - Booked slots are clearly grayed out in the calendar
  - Clicking a booked slot shows immediate feedback via toast
  - Booking dialog never opens for unavailable times
  - Users can easily identify which slots are available at a glance

### Added: ParticipantSelector with User Suggestions
- **Feature**: Participants field in booking forms now auto-populates from registered users with dropdown selection
- **Implementation**:
  1. **ParticipantSelector Component**: Created reusable component with:
     - Multi-select dropdown showing all registered users from the database
     - Searchable/filterable user list with autocomplete
     - Manual email entry option for users not in the system
     - Selected participants displayed as removable badges
     - Proper loading and error state handling
  2. **Integration**: Added to both BookingForm and AdvancedBookingForm
  3. **Data Fetching**: Uses TanStack Query to fetch users from `/api/users` endpoint with proper error handling
- **Files Modified**:
  - `client/src/components/ParticipantSelector.tsx` (new component)
  - `client/src/components/BookingForm.tsx` (integrated ParticipantSelector)
  - `client/src/components/AdvancedBookingForm.tsx` (integrated ParticipantSelector)
- **User Experience**: 
  - Click dropdown to see all users with names and emails
  - Search/filter users by name or email
  - Select multiple users from dropdown
  - Manually add external participant emails not in the system
  - Remove participants by clicking X on badge

## Recent Changes (October 8, 2025)

### Fixed: Repeat Bookings Not Showing in Calendar/Scheduler
- **Issue**: When users selected daily, weekly, or custom repeat options and booked a room, the booking would be created but wouldn't show up in the calendar scheduler for the repeated dates
- **Root Cause**: 
  1. The backend was only creating ONE booking record with repeat settings stored, but the calendar expected multiple booking instances for each occurrence
  2. RadioGroup in BookingForm was not controlled (missing `value` prop)
  3. Custom days selection UI was completely missing from both forms
- **Fix Applied**:
  1. **Calendar Display Logic**: Added booking expansion logic in `CalendarView.tsx` that:
     - Automatically expands daily bookings to show on each day for 60 days
     - Expands weekly bookings to show on the same day of the week
     - Expands custom bookings to show only on selected weekdays
  2. **Form Controls**: 
     - Fixed RadioGroup to be controlled with `value={form.watch('repeatType')}`
     - Added custom days selection UI with clickable day buttons
     - Added validation when custom is selected but no days are chosen
  3. **Interface Updates**: Added `repeatType` and `customDays` to the Booking interface
- **Files Modified**:
  - `client/src/components/CalendarView.tsx` (booking expansion logic)
  - `client/src/components/BookingForm.tsx` (form controls)
  - `client/src/components/AdvancedBookingForm.tsx` (form controls)
- **How It Works Now**:
  - Daily: Booking appears every day for 60 days from start date
  - Weekly: Booking appears on the same weekday each week
  - Custom: Booking appears only on the specific days you select (e.g., Mon/Wed/Fri)
